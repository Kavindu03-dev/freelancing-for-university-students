# Matching and Recommendations - Functional Requirement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the fourth functional requirement: "Matching and Recommendations" for the freelancing platform for university students.

### Recommendation Algorithm Architecture
```javascript
// Student Opportunity Matching Algorithm
const generateRecommendations = () => {
  return availableOpportunities
    .map(opportunity => {
      let score = 0;
      
      // Skills match (40% weight)
      const skillMatches = opportunity.requiredSkills.filter(skill => 
        studentSkills.some(studentSkill => 
          studentSkill.includes(skill.toLowerCase()) || 
          skill.toLowerCase().includes(studentSkill)
        )
      ).length;
      score += (skillMatches / opportunity.requiredSkills.length) * 40;
      
      // Degree relevance (30% weight)
      if (opportunity.degreeField.toLowerCase() === studentDegree) {
        score += 30;
      } else if (opportunity.degreeField.toLowerCase().includes(studentDegree) || 
                 studentDegree.includes(opportunity.degreeField.toLowerCase())) {
        score += 20;
      }
      
      // Profile completeness bonus (20% weight)
      score += (profileCompleteness / 100) * 20;
      
      // Activity bonus (10% weight)
      const recentActivity = stats.activeProjects + stats.completedProjects;
      if (recentActivity > 10) score += 10;
      else if (recentActivity > 5) score += 5;
      
      return { ...opportunity, recommendationScore: Math.round(score) };
    })
    .filter(opp => opp.recommendationScore > 30)
    .sort((a, b) => b.recommendationScore - a.recommendationScore);
};

// Client Freelancer Matching Algorithm
const getRecommendedFreelancers = (postRequirements = null) => {
  return recommendedFreelancers
    .map(freelancer => {
      let score = 0;
      
      // Skills match (40% weight)
      const requiredSkills = postRequirements?.requiredSkills || [];
      const skillMatches = requiredSkills.filter(skill => 
        freelancer.skills.some(freelancerSkill => 
          freelancerSkill.toLowerCase().includes(skill.toLowerCase()) ||
          skill.toLowerCase().includes(freelancerSkill.toLowerCase())
        )
      ).length;
      score += (skillMatches / requiredSkills.length) * 40;
      
      // Rating (25% weight)
      score += (freelancer.rating / 5) * 25;
      
      // Profile completeness (20% weight)
      score += (freelancer.profileCompleteness / 100) * 20;
      
      // Experience (15% weight)
      score += Math.min(freelancer.completedProjects / 20, 1) * 15;
      
      return { ...freelancer, recommendationScore: Math.round(score) };
    })
    .filter(freelancer => freelancer.recommendationScore > 30)
    .sort((a, b) => b.recommendationScore - a.recommendationScore);
};
```

### Profile Completeness Calculation
```javascript
const calculateProfileCompleteness = (studentData) => {
  if (!studentData) return 0;
  
  const fields = [
    studentData.firstName, studentData.lastName, studentData.email,
    studentData.degreeProgram, studentData.university, studentData.gpa,
    studentData.graduationYear, studentData.technicalSkills
  ];
  
  const completedFields = fields.filter(field => field && field.trim() !== '').length;
  return Math.round((completedFields / fields.length) * 100);
};
```
