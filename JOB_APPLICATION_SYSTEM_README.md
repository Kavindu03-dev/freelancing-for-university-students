- `createdAt` for chronological ordering

## API Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Job application submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "application_id",
    "postId": "post_id",
    "fullName": "Applicant Name",

5. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling

## Testing

### Backend Testing
- All API endpoints tested for proper authentication
- File upload functionality verified
- Database operations tested for data integrity
- Error handling validated for edge cases

### Frontend Testing
- Form validation tested across different browsers
- File upload interface tested with various file types
- Responsive design verified on mobile devices
- User workflow tested end-to-end

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
- Ensure file upload directories have proper write permissions
- Configure maximum file size limits in server configuration
- Set up proper CORS settings for file uploads

### Database Migration
- No existing data migration required
- New collections will be created automatically
- Indexes will be built on first application creation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Upload Failures**: Check directory permissions and file size limits
2. **Authentication Errors**: Verify JWT token validity and expiration
3. **Database Connection**: Ensure MongoDB connection is stable
4. **File Type Errors**: Verify file extension and MIME type validation

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check file upload directory permissions
ls -la uploads/job-applications/

# Verify MongoDB connection
mongo --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"

# Check application logs
tail -f logs/application.log
```
